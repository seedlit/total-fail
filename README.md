I was experimenting with Random Forests, and I thought of predicting times when elon will tweet, based on his previous tweet times (year, month, date, weekday, hour, minute). <br>
This was a total fail experiment. I got ~35% accuracy on validation set. <br> <br>

Regardless, these scripts still have some useful functions (scraping tweets, plotting, etc.).
